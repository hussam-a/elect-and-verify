# Elect and Verify (EnV): A system for online verifiable elections

EnV is intended to replace traditional paper-based voting systems as well as online voting systems whose results cannot be publicly audited. EnV is an online verifiable open-audit voting system. EnV also includes solutions for electoral campaigns and debates. EnV is not designed however to solve the problem of coercion.
